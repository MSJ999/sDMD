Installation:

In folder "src", please use,
	$make sDMD
to build the main simulation executable "sDMD". If users also would like to perform a replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation, please use,
	$make all
to build the all three executables "sDMD", "sREMD" and "sServer".

In folder "analysis", please use,
	$make
to build the analysis executable "sAnalysis".




Execution:

To perform a regular DMD simulation, please use,
	$./sDMD [args]
The supported arguments and their descriptions can be shown by,
	$./sDMD -h

To perform a REMD simulation, please place the three executables "sDMD", "sREMD" and "sServer" in the same directory and use,
	$./sREMD [args]
The supported arguments and their descriptions can be shown by,
	$./sREMD -h

To perform an analysis, please use,
	$./sAnalysis [args]
The supported arguments and their descriptions can be shown by,
	$./sAnalysis -h
